## A lightweight 3D viewer for computer graphics students ##

With this project we present the work in progress along with some preliminary research results in the field of Computational Geometry and Mesh Processing obtained by the Computer Graphics Group of the University of Cagliari, Italy.

We focus on the work in mesh analysis by introducing the development of a lightweight visualization and processing tool that helped expanding the aims of our group by letting the students from the University move their first steps in Computer Graphics.
